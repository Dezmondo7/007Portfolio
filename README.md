The project goal was to build a responsive web portfolio. The portfolio was to be built using HTML and advanced CSS following a blue print design as a guide. The webiste I created was a bespoke version of the blue print using enhanced features including some javascript and animated functions. In the next step I will document how the site was built in stages. 

## Functionality
